            <h1>Green Day</h1>
            <p>Green Day, American rock band that infused the raw power of punk with a melodic pop sensibility and
                lyrics that captured the angst-ridden restlessness of American teenagers at the end of the 20th century
                and into the 21st. The principal members were Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt, and Tré Cool.</p>

                <p><strong>Dookie</strong> is the third studio album and the major label debut by American rock band
                    Green Day, released
                    on February 1, 1994, by Reprise Records. The band's first collaboration with producer Rob Cavallo,
                    it was recorded in late summer 1993 at Fantasy Studios in Berkeley, California. Written mostly by
                    frontman Billie Joe Armstrong, the album is heavily based around his personal experiences, with
                    themes such as boredom, anxiety, relationships, and sexuality.</p>

                <img src="./images/nimrod-cover.jpg" alt="Nimrod Cover">
                <p><strong>Nimrod</strong> is the fifth studio album by American rock band Green Day, released on
                    October 14, 1997, by
                    Reprise Records. The band began work on the album in the wake of the cancellation of a European tour
                    after the release of their previous album, Insomniac. Recorded at Conway Recording Studios in Los
                    Angeles, the album was written with the intent of creating a set of standalone songs as opposed to a
                    cohesive album. Retrospectively, Nimrod is noted for its musical diversity and experimentation,
                    containing elements of folk, hardcore, surf rock, and ska. Lyrical themes discussed include
                    maturity, personal reflection, and fatherhood.</p>

                <p><strong>Warning</strong> is the sixth studio album by American rock band Green Day, released on
                    October 3, 2000, by
                    Reprise Records. Building upon its predecessor Nimrod (1997), it eschewed the band's trademark punk
                    rock sound and incorporated acoustic elements and pop and folk styles. Lyrically, the album contains
                    more optimistic and inspirational themes in comparison to the band's earlier releases.</p>

                <img src="./images/american-idiot-cover.png" alt="American Idiot Cover">
                <p><strong>American Idiot</strong> is the seventh studio album by American rock band Green Day, released
                    on September 21,
                    2004, by Reprise Records. The album was produced by Rob Cavallo in collaboration with Green Day, an
                    arrangement the group have been using since they signed with a major label. Recording sessions for
                    American Idiot were made at Studio 880, in Oakland and Ocean Way Recording in Hollywood, both in
                    California, between 2003 and 2004. A concept album, dubbed a "punk rock opera" by the band members,
                    American Idiot follows the story of Jesus of Suburbia, a lower-middle-class American adolescent
                    anti-hero. The album expresses the disillusionment and dissent of a generation that came of age in a
                    period shaped by tumultuous events such as 9/11 and the Iraq War. In order to accomplish this, the
                    band used unconventional techniques for themselves, including transitions between connected songs
                    and some long, chaptered, creative compositions presenting the album themes.</p>
